# Liked Listings Synchronization Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of real-time synchronization between Like buttons and the Liked Listings Modal.

## User Requirement
**When a user clicks the Like button—whether on a Property Card or within the Property Details Modal—the corresponding property should appear in the Liked Listings Modal. Conversely, if the property is unliked (the heart icon or Like button is deselected), it should be immediately removed from the Liked Listings Modal.**

## Implementation

### 1. Enhanced `useLikedListings` Hook (`hooks/useUserData.ts`)

**Changes:**
- Modified `checkIfLiked()` to be synchronous and check against local state for immediate feedback
- Added `checkIfLikedAsync()` for cases where backend verification is needed
- Both functions properly maintain state consistency

**Benefits:**
- Faster UI updates (no async delay)
- Consistent state across components
- Better performance

```typescript
const checkIfLiked = useCallback((listingKey: string) => {
  // Check against the local state first for immediate feedback
  return likedListings.some(item => item.listingKey === listingKey);
}, [likedListings]);
```

### 2. Auto-Refresh Modal (`components/Auth/Modals/LikedListingsModal.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added `useEffect` that listens for modal open state
- Automatically refreshes liked listings when modal opens
- Ensures modal always displays current state

```typescript
// Refresh the list whenever the modal opens
useEffect(() => {
  if (open) {
    refresh();
  }
}, [open, refresh]);
```

**Benefits:**
- Modal always shows up-to-date liked listings
- Picks up likes/unlikes from Property Cards and Details Modal
- Seamless user experience

### 3. Updated Like Button Components

**Modified Files:**
- `components/Property/Listings/PropertyCard/Image.tsx`
- `components/Property/Details/PropertyDetailsHeader.tsx`
- `components/Property/Details/PropertyGallery.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Updated to use synchronous `checkIfLiked()` function
- Properly handle state updates in `useEffect`

```typescript
// Check if property is liked whenever likedListings changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (property?.ListingKey) {
    setIsFavorite(checkIfLiked(property.ListingKey));
  }
}, [property?.ListingKey, checkIfLiked]);
```

## User Flow Examples

### Scenario 1: Like from Property Card → View in Modal
1. User browses property listings
2. User clicks heart icon on a Property Card
3. Toast notification: "Added to liked listings"
4. Backend is updated, local state is updated
5. User clicks "Liked Listings" in User Menu
6. Modal opens → `useEffect` triggers → `refresh()` loads latest data
7. **Result:** Newly liked property appears in the modal ✓

### Scenario 2: Unlike from Modal → State Updates
1. User opens Liked Listings Modal
2. User clicks "Remove" button on a property
3. `unlikeListing()` is called → backend updated
4. `refresh()` is called → state reloaded
5. **Result:** Property is immediately removed from the modal ✓

### Scenario 3: Like from Details Modal → View in Liked Listings
1. User clicks on a property to view details
2. Property Details Modal opens with Like button in header and gallery
3. User clicks Like button
4. Toast notification: "Added to liked listings"
5. Backend and local state are updated
6. User closes Details Modal and opens Liked Listings Modal
7. Modal opens → auto-refreshes
8. **Result:** Property appears in Liked Listings ✓

### Scenario 4: Multiple Likes → All Appear in Modal
1. User likes Property A from Property Card
2. User likes Property B from Property Details Modal
3. User likes Property C from Gallery
4. User opens Liked Listings Modal
5. Modal refreshes on open
6. **Result:** All three properties appear in the modal ✓

## Technical Architecture

### State Management Flow
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Property Card     │
│   (Like Button)     │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           │ likeListing(property)
           ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  useLikedListings Hook      │
│  - likedListings[]          │
│  - likeListing()            │
│  - unlikeListing()          │
│  - checkIfLiked()           │
│  - refresh()                │
└──────────┬──────────────────┘
           │
           │ Updates backend & local state
           ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  userDataService            │
│  (In-memory storage)        │
│  - addLikedListing()        │
│  - removeLikedListing()     │
│  - getLikedListings()       │
└──────────┬──────────────────┘
           │
           │ Modal opens → refresh()
           ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Liked Listings Modal       │
│  - Displays all liked       │
│  - Auto-refreshes on open   │
│  - Allows unlike            │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Component Communication
- Each component using `useLikedListings()` gets its own state instance
- Modal refreshes on open to sync with backend
- Backend (in-memory storage) serves as single source of truth
- All components query backend for latest state

## Backend Service (`lib/userDataService.ts`)

The current implementation uses in-memory storage with the following functions:
- `addLikedListing()` - Adds a property to liked listings
- `removeLikedListing()` - Removes a property from liked listings
- `getLikedListings()` - Gets all liked listings for a user
- `isListingLiked()` - Checks if a specific property is liked

**Note:** This can be easily replaced with real API calls to Supabase or another backend in the future.

## Future Enhancements

### Option 1: Global State Management
- Implement Context API or Zustand for shared state
- All components would share the same state instance
- Changes would propagate instantly without refresh

### Option 2: Real-time Subscriptions
- When integrated with Supabase, use real-time subscriptions
- Components would automatically update when backend changes
- True real-time multi-device synchronization

### Option 3: Optimistic Updates with Rollback
- Update UI immediately, then sync with backend
- If backend fails, rollback UI changes
- Better user experience with instant feedback

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Like from Property Card → appears in modal
- [x] Like from Details Modal → appears in modal
- [x] Unlike from modal → immediately removed

- [x] No TypeScript/linter errors
- [x] Proper error handling with toast notifications
- [x] Loading states handled correctly

## Files Modified

1. `hooks/useUserData.ts` - Enhanced hook with synchronous state checking
2. `components/Auth/Modals/LikedListingsModal.tsx` - Added auto-refresh on open
3. `components/Property/Listings/PropertyCard/Image.tsx` - Updated to use sync check
4. `components/Property/Details/PropertyDetailsHeader.tsx` - Updated to use sync check

- ✅ Like button on Property Card adds property to Liked Listings Modal
- ✅ Like button in Property Details Modal adds property to Liked Listings Modal
- ✅ Unlike action immediately removes property from modal
- ✅ All state changes are properly synchronized
