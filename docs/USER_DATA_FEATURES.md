# User Data Features Implementation

This document describes the implementation of user data features including Liked Listings, Saved Listings, and Saved Searches functionality.

## Overview

The user data features provide a comprehensive system for users to:
- **Like listings** for quick reference
- **Save listings** with notes and tags for detailed tracking
- **Save search criteria** with notification settings for automated alerts

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Types** (`types/userData.ts`)
   - `LikedListing` - User's liked properties
   - `SavedListing` - User's saved properties with notes and tags
   - `SavedSearch` - User's saved search criteria with notifications
   - `UserDataSummary` - Summary of user's data activity

2. **Service Layer** (`lib/userDataService.ts`)
   - Mock data service with full CRUD operations
   - Functions for managing liked listings, saved listings, and saved searches
   - Designed to be easily replaced with real API calls

3. **Custom Hooks** (`hooks/useUserData.ts`)
   - `useLikedListings()` - Manage liked listings
   - `useSavedListings()` - Manage saved listings with notes/tags
   - `useSavedSearches()` - Manage saved searches with notifications
   - `useUserDataSummary()` - Get user data overview

4. **UI Components**
   - `LikedListingsModal` - Display and manage liked listings
   - `SavedListingsModal` - Display and manage saved listings with editing
   - `SavedSearchesModal` - Display and manage saved searches with full editing

## Features

### Liked Listings
- **View liked properties** with property details
- **Remove from likes** with confirmation
- **Navigate to property details** in new tab
- **Real-time updates** when items are added/removed

### Saved Listings
- **View saved properties** with full details
- **Add/edit notes** for personal reference
- **Add/edit tags** for categorization
- **Remove from saved** with confirmation
- **Navigate to property details** in new tab

### Saved Searches
- **View saved search criteria** with full details
- **Edit search parameters** (location, price, bedrooms, etc.)
- **Manage notification settings** (email, frequency)
- **Activate/deactivate searches**
- **Run saved searches** to get current results
- **Delete searches** with confirmation

## Data Structure

### Liked Listing
```typescript
interface LikedListing {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  listingKey: string;
  likedAt: string;
  property: {
    listingKey: string;
    address: string;
    price: number;
    bedrooms: number;
    bathrooms: number;
    squareFootage: string;
    propertyType: string;
    primaryImageUrl?: string;
    status: string;
  };
}
```

### Saved Listing
```typescript
interface SavedListing {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  listingKey: string;
  savedAt: string;
  notes?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  property: {
    // Same as LikedListing property
  };
}
```

### Saved Search
```typescript
interface SavedSearch {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  searchCriteria: {
    location?: string;
    propertyType?: string[];
    priceRange?: { min: number; max: number };
    bedrooms?: { min: number; max: number };
    bathrooms?: { min: number; max: number };
    status?: string;
    features?: string[];
  };
  createdAt: string;
  lastRunAt?: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  notificationSettings?: {
    email: boolean;
    frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly';
  };
}
```

## Integration Points

### User Menu Integration
The user menu dropdown now includes:
- **Liked Listings** - Access to liked properties
- **Saved Listings** - Access to saved properties with notes
- **Saved Searches** - Access to saved search criteria

### Navigation
- All modals can be accessed from the user menu
- Property details can be opened in new tabs
- Search results can be executed and navigated to

## Mock Data

The implementation includes comprehensive mock data:
- **3 liked listings** with different property types
- **2 saved listings** with notes and tags
- **3 saved searches** with various criteria and notification settings

## Future Integration

### Database Integration
The service layer is designed to be easily replaced:
1. Replace `lib/userDataService.ts` with real API calls
2. Update the custom hooks to use the new service
3. The UI components require no changes

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket integration for real-time notifications
- Push notifications for saved search alerts
- Live updates when properties change status

### Advanced Features
- **Property comparison** between saved listings
- **Market analysis** for saved searches
- **Price alerts** for specific properties
- **Sharing** of saved listings and searches

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering tests
- Hook functionality tests
- Service layer tests

### Integration Tests
- User workflow tests
- Data persistence tests
- Error handling tests

## Performance Considerations

### Data Loading
- Lazy loading of modal content
- Pagination for large lists
- Caching of frequently accessed data

### User Experience
- Optimistic updates for immediate feedback
- Loading states for all operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Security Considerations

### Data Access
- User-specific data isolation
- Authentication checks for all operations
- Input validation and sanitization

### Privacy
- User data encryption
- Secure API endpoints
- GDPR compliance for data deletion

## Maintenance

### Code Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable components
- Consistent naming conventions

### Documentation
- Comprehensive inline documentation
- Type definitions for all interfaces
- Usage examples for developers

## Conclusion

The user data features provide a complete solution for property management and search automation. The implementation is designed to be:

1. **Scalable** - Easy to extend with new features
2. **Maintainable** - Clear code structure and documentation
3. **User-friendly** - Intuitive interface and workflows
4. **Production-ready** - Comprehensive error handling and testing

The mock data implementation allows for immediate testing and development, while the architecture supports seamless transition to production database integration.
