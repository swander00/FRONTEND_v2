# Mock Map View with Property Markers

## Overview
The map view now displays a placeholder map with mock property markers when Google Maps API is not configured. This provides a realistic preview of how the map would look with actual property data.

## How to Access Map View

1. **Navigate to the search page**: Go to `/search` or the main search page
2. **Click the "Map" button**: In the top-right area, you'll see "Grid" and "Map" toggle buttons
3. **View the mock map**: The right side will show a placeholder map with property markers

## Features

### Mock Property Markers
- **Location-based positioning**: Properties are positioned based on their Toronto neighborhoods
- **Price display**: Each marker shows the property price (e.g., "$750K", "$1.2M")
- **Color coding**: 
  - Blue markers: Active listings
  - Red markers: New listings
- **Interactive tooltips**: Hover over markers to see property details
- **Click functionality**: Click markers to select properties

### Map Features
- **Grid overlay**: Simulates a real map background
- **Legend**: Shows marker color meanings
- **Property count**: Displays total number of properties
- **Full-screen toggle**: "Expand Map" button for full-screen view
- **Responsive design**: Works on different screen sizes

### Property Information
Each marker displays:
- Property address
- List price
- Bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage
- Property type and status
- "New Listing" badge for new properties

## Mock Data Locations

Properties are positioned in realistic Toronto neighborhoods:
- **Downtown**: Financial District properties
- **Queen West**: Trendy neighborhood properties  
- **Little Italy**: Community-focused properties
- **Midtown**: Central Toronto properties
- **Yonge-Eglinton**: North Toronto properties
- **Annex**: University area properties
- **King West**: Entertainment district properties

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `components/Search/MapView/MapView.tsx` - Main map component
- `lib/mockMapData.ts` - Mock location data and utilities
- `lib/index.ts` - Export mock map utilities

### Key Components
- **PlaceholderMap**: Custom map component with SVG grid overlay
- **Property markers**: Interactive markers with hover effects
- **Location mapping**: Maps properties to Toronto neighborhoods
- **Responsive positioning**: Converts lat/lng to pixel coordinates

## Future Enhancements

When Google Maps API is configured:
- Real Google Maps integration
- Street view integration
- Directions to properties
- Satellite/terrain view options
- Advanced clustering
- Custom marker icons

## Usage Notes

- The placeholder map is shown when `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is not set
- All property locations are mock data for demonstration
- Markers are positioned with slight randomization for visual variety
- The map automatically fits bounds to show all properties
